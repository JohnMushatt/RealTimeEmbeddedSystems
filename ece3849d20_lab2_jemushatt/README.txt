This program creates a digital oscilloscope that renders the waveform of a 20 KHz 40% duty cycle signal generated 
from the onboard PWM generator.
The display shows the time scale (20 us), the voltage division (default 1 V, range of .1V-2V)
It also shows the current trigger mode (Rising or falling)
Additionally, at the bottom, there is a counter for the number of errors generated by the ADC1 Overflow Flag
as well as the current load the CPU is handling.


This program also offers a new spectrum analyzer that can be activated via pressing the lower booster board button.
Pressing this will show a new interface displaying the current waveform after it has undergone a fast fourier transform.
Additionally, this program is now using an RTOS to schedule tasks to handle achieving deadlines.
