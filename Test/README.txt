This program creates a digital oscilloscope that renders the waveform of a 20 KHz 40% duty cycle signal generated 
from the onboard PWM generator.
The display shows the time scale (20 us), the voltage division (default 1 V, range of .1V-2V)
It also shows the current trigger mode (Rising or falling)
Additionally, at the bottom, there is a counter for the number of errors generated by the ADC1 Overflow Flag
as well as the current load the CPU is handling.


This program also offers a new spectrum analyzer that can be activated via pressing the lower booster board button.
Pressing this will show a new interface displaying the current waveform after it has undergone a fast fourier transform.
Additionally, this program is now using an RTOS to schedule tasks to handle achieving deadlines.


Lab 3 Update:
The program now offers new extensions.
Pushing the joystick left/right will now adjust the new PWM period souce by -1/+1 cpu cycle which will affect the new audio function
Pressing the top button on the booster pack will now play audio based on the current source period. 
The user interface now also displays the current  frequency of the source waveform
Pressing on the top launchpad button will also toggle the DMA sample rate between 1 MSPS <-> 2 MSPS
